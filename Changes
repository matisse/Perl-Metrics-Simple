0.031 - Thu Dec 14 09:05:15 PST 2006
 Fixed bug in the  countperl  script. Was reporting the median instead
 of mean for the summary complexity numbers.
 Thanks to Ovid for spotting this.

0.03 - Sat Dec  2 09:01:41 PST 2006
 The "main" stats for each file now have the same format as the stats for
 a subroutine: Added 'name' and 'path' keys to the hash.
 The 'name' is always:     {code not in named subroutines}

 Changed the 'countperl' script to use the new data structure to add
 the {code not in named subroutines} to the list of subroutines it reports.

0.022 - Sun Nov 26 22:08:47 PST 2006
 Line counts now exclude blank lines, comments and pod.
 Complexity counts now will be 0 (zero) for code that is only comments/pod.

0.021 - Sat Nov 25 22:46:23 PST 2006
 Mostly changes to improve Kwalitee. See http://cpants.perl.org/kwalitee.html
 Added pod.
 Added tests for Pod and Pod coverage.

0.02

  Added  '!' and  'not' to list of logic operators that add t complexity scores.
  Installs new script 'countperl' which creates report in text format.
  Made various changes to satisfy perlcritic.
  Made a change to list_perl_files() to work with old versions of File::Find.
